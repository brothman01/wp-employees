Just a simple WordPress plugin that adds a lightweight, responsive team page that beautifully shows visitors your team.  There are options to display this information with a shortcode, a WordPress block or a Visual Composer block.

You can set the block settings to show info about a specific team member or the entire team.

== Installation ==
Download the plugin from the official WordPress repo and click \'Activate\' when the plugin has finished downloading or download a zip file of the plugin and install it manually.

Upon activation, this plugin adds a simple 'Staff' menu to configure the staff, and a then blocks or shortcodes to easily add it to your site. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
How do I configure the staff section?
On the dashboard, there is now a button marked 'Staff'.  Click that button and add each staff member to the staff list.  When click into a staff member there are fields for name, portrait, etc. Fill out those fields to decide what information is shown on the page.

How can I display my amazing team page to the world?
After you have filled out the 'Staff' section on your dashboard, decide if you want to use a block, a shortcode or the Visual Composer section.  

If you want to use a block, then while editing a page add the block called 'Team Page (react)' or 'Team Page (vanillajs).  Both of those blocks will show the same information so the only difference is if you want to use react or vanillajs,  most people do not care so you can choose either if you have no preference.

If you want to use a shortcode, then while editing a page add the shortcode block and fill it with TODO: FIX THIS TO SHOW ALL
